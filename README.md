# OIBSIP Java Task 2 – Number Guessing Game

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple Java-based Number Guessing Game where the system generates a random number and the user attempts to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 24)
- VS Code
- Java Extension Pack
- Git & GitHub

---

## Project Description
- The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- The system provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game limits the number of attempts.
- Multiple rounds are supported.
- A score is calculated based on the number of attempts taken.

---

## Steps Performed
1. Created a Java console-based application.
2. Implemented random number generation.
3. Used loops and conditional statements for game logic.
4. Added attempt limitation and scoring system.
5. Tested the program for multiple rounds.
6. Prepared the project for GitHub submission.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Navigate to the `src` folder.
3. Run the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file using:
   - VS Code Run button  
   **OR**
   - Terminal:
     ```bash
     javac NumberGuessingGame.java
     java NumberGuessingGame
     ```
